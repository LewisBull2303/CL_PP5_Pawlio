## Design

The color scheme for this application was inspired by other similar social media websites such as instagram and twitter, focusing mainly on base colors like, white, gray and black. It was my aim to keep the colors fairly neutral to create a calming and familiar feel to the whole webpage, another benefit that it adds is that the objects with colors such as the like button, profile pictures and images all stand out more. The use of neautral colors allows the users focus to be drawn to the images on the page allowing for better user engagement. The Apps background color is an off white with the navbar matching but being seperated by a black line boarder. The main content page is then white to add contrast and once again draw in the focus of the user. The buttons are all black at a base line but when hovered over turn blue and when active also become blue. The like button is at a base black, but when hovered and not liked, becomes red, when it is liked it is a full red and when it it liked and hovered over it becomes blue. All of these colors were carefully thought out to allow for contrast and clear directionn on what the user can interact with.

## Fonts

Google fonts were used on the website. Iter was used as my main font with sans serif as the backup font. Inter was used throughout the site to ensure high legibility of the content.

# Front-end

## React

React is a flexible, efficient, and declarative JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. It simplifies managing an interface and its state by breaking the UI into independent, reusable components.

I chose React for this application for several key reasons:

- Performance: React significantly improves page load speed, enhancing overall user experience by minimizing wait times.

- Modularity and Maintainability: React’s component-based architecture makes the codebase more flexible and easier to maintain compared to many other front-end frameworks.

- React Bootstrap: To enhance styling and responsiveness, I incorporated React Bootstrap. It offers pre-built components tailored for React, designed with accessibility in mind—an essential aspect of front-end development. Having previously worked with plain Bootstrap, transitioning to React Bootstrap was a natural and efficient choice.

- Industry Adoption: React is widely used in building social media and content-driven platforms, including by major companies like Meta (Facebook), Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb.

- Component Reusability: React allows developers to reuse components across different parts of the application, reducing redundancy and streamlining development.

There were several components created and re-used for this application:

- Asset - multipurpose reusable compontent which displays different versions of the component depending on the props we pass to it
  - loading gif (spinner) when content is being loaded
  - image with src and alt attribute
  - paragraph with a message

## Future Improvements / Additional Features

Below are some of the ways that this project could be improved in the future

1. Better user authentication, potentially requiring an email addess thet would need to be confirmed before allowing access to the platform
2. Options to send other users messages on the app, through a personal messaging system
3. Ability for users to make their own categories and tags to allow for more freedom of expression
4. Forgot password button to allow users to reset their password if they could not log into their account
5. Allow authentication through other apps such as google, linkedIn, Instagram etc
6. A page that shows the most liked or commented posts on the website
7. Ability to reply to other users comments
8. Option to like other users comments

There was originally plans for the users to be able to private message each other on the website, but I decided to keep the app more streamlined to allow for further growth and progression

## Validation

## Performing Tests on Different Devices

The website was tested using Google Chrome Developer Tools Toggle Device Toolbar to simulate viewports of different devices.

The website was tested on the following devices:

- ASUS ZenBook (laptop screen)
- Samsung Galaxy Tab A (tablet screen)
- Samsung S7 (mobile screen)

## Browser Compatibility

Testing has been carried out on the following browsers, no issues were found:

- Googe Chrome
- Firefox Browser
- Microsoft Edge

## Bugs

|Bug|Fix|
|---|---|
|On small screens, the hamburger menu would not appear|Updated the logic in the code to correctly check the screen size and then display the hamburger menu icon|
|Users profile would not update when edited|Updated the logic to allow the request to go through to the backend|
|Issue where the comment and profile dropdown menu would not appear|Corrected the drf_api.serializer in the backend to see if the user correct user is logged in|

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment

This application has been deployed from Github using Heroku. Here's how:

1. Create an account at heroku.com
2. Create an app, give it a name for such as ci-pp4-the-wave, and select a region
3. Under resources search for postgres, and add a Postgres database to the app

### Heroku Postgres
For the backend of this project, please see a link [here](https://github.com/LewisBull2303/Pawlio_drf_api) the below instructions detail how to set up the backend of the project
1. Note the DATABASE_URL, this can be set as an environment variable in Heroku and your local deployment(env.py)
2. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary.
3. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file
4. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn the_wave.wsgi
5. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database, no indentation if you are not using a separate test database. I store mine in env.py
6. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file
7. Add localhost, and ci-pp4-the-wave.herokuapp.com to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
8. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations
9. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database
10. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user
11. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata categories.json" on the categories file in products/fixtures to create the categories
12. Run "python3 manage.py loaddata products.json" on the products file in products/fixtures to create the products
13. Install gunicorn and add it to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
14. Ensure the following environment variables are set in Heroku
15. Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from main if you wish
16. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time
17. Click on the link provided to access the application
18. If you encounter any issues accessing the build logs is a good way to troubleshoot the issue

## Credits

404 Image was taken from [here](https://nicepage.com/sd/758347/404-page-with-cat-website-design) and edited using [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/)
The default Profile picture and post image was taken from the [Moments](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard) project by Code institute

### Code

This project was inspired by the [Moments](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard) social media platform which was a final walk-through project with Code Institute. I have adjusted the project and added additonal features, such as filtering of posts based on their category and Saving posts privately. The Pawlio application can be expanded on and include the potential improvements mentioned in the 'Future features / improvements' section.

Thank you to Aleksandra for help with the file set up and styles
